## Numerical Methods in Computational Physics

This involved implementation of some numerical techniques, like the [Euler](/https://github.com/AtharvTambade/SOC/blob/main/Euler_method.ipynb), Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods. This is illustrated in a [jupyter notebook](/Numerical%20Methods/Apurv_Numerical_Method.ipynb). There are also Fortran codes for these methods.

## Visualizing Poisson Equation Solutions

This was the first Mini-Project. The project involved solving the [Poisson equation](/Poisson%20Equation/) using the finite difference method. There is a [jupyter notebook](/Poisson%20Equation/Apurv_poisson_solutions.ipynb) and a [Fortran code](/Poisson%20Equation/poisson.f90) for this. The Fortran code produces a text file with pixel position and value.

## Visualizing Hydrogen atom wavefunctions

This was the second Mini-Project. The [project](/Hydrogen%20Atom/) involved numerically solving for eigenstates and eigenvalues of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for hydrogen atom. Similar content as mini-project one.

## Visualizing Time Evolution systems

This was the third Mini-Project. The project involves solving [time evolution](/Time%20Evolutions/) systems of equations using Runge-Kutta Algorithms.

## Raytracing in Curved Spacetime

This is an open-ended project. The project involves visualizing a Kerr Blackhole by solving null geodesics around the spacetime. I have written the code in C++ and Fortran. The code prints an image in ppm P3 format. To save it, run

```console
$ ./a.out > image.ppm
```

This was the final result.
