## Numerical Methods in Computational Physics

This involved implementation of some numerical techniques, like the [Euler](/Euler_method.ipynb), [Jacobi](/Jacobi_method.ipynb), [Gauss-Seidel](/Gauss-Seidel_Method.ipynb), [Newton-Raphson](/Newton_raphson.ipynb).

## Visualizing Poisson Equation Solutions

This was the first Mini-Project. The project involved solving the [Poisson equation](/Mini_Project_1.ipynb) using the finite difference method.

## Visualizing Hydrogen atom wavefunctions

This was the second Mini-Project. The [project](/hydrogen_atom_mini_project_2.ipynb) involved numerically solving for eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen atoms. Similar content as mini-project one.

## Visualizing Time Evolution systems

This was the third Mini-Project. The project involves solving [time evolution](/Atharv_3_assignment.ipynb) systems of equations using Runge-Kutta Algorithms.

## Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting

I am trying to implement the paper [10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.160601](/Diffusion%20with%20Stochastic%20Resetting.pdf). so the concept is as follows:
We have a stochastic particle at centre let's say it's needed to reach a specific distance. At that distance we have absorbers Also particles have one more property which is resetting, like it will get reset and that will depend on its diffusion rate. So we will try to find the optimal rate at which the particle reaches the Target earlier
